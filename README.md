EnviroClock is an embedded system project based on the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller.
It functions as a real-time digital clock that displays the Time (hh:mm:ss), Date (DD:MM:YYYY), and Day of the Week (Sun–Sat) on a 16x2 LCD.
The project also integrates an LM35 temperature sensor to measure ambient temperature using the microcontroller’s ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter.
The system is ideal for learning embedded systems concepts such as RTC interfacing, ADC programming, and LCD display control using Embedded C.
